## 👋🏾 Hey, I'm Estervelle

I started as a **data engineer** and transitioned into **platform engineering** to design and manage scalable, containerized systems from the ground up.

I'm focused on building real-world projects that combine **data pipeline architecture** with **infrastructure, automation, and observability**.


### 🔧 Tech I Work With
- **Containers & Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes (Minikube, AKS)
- **Cloud & Infrastructure**: Azure, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, Terraform
- **Data Engineering Stack**: Python, SQL, Kafka, PostgreSQ



### ⚙️ Featured Projects


#### Dockerized Lambda Data Platform  
8-container architecture simulating a lambda-style data flow — includes Kafka, FastAPI, Postgres, and monitoring stack.

#### Kubernetes Home Lab (AKS + Minikube) - in progress
Lightweight deployment of FastAPI + Postgres using Kubernetes. Includes readiness probes, resource limits, and CI/CD hooks.  


#### Observability Simulation - in progress
Custom-built logging & metrics pipelines that simulate real-world observability workflows.

🛠️ _This GitHub is my lab. I build, break, and rebuild to master platform engineering through real-world projects._
