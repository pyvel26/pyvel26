## üëãüèæ Hello!

I started my career as a **data engineer**, building pipelines that moved and transformed data for analytics and reporting.  
Over time, those pipelines evolved into **full-fledged platforms** and I found myself just as interested in the **infrastructure, orchestration, and automation** as the data itself.  

With the help of AI and a lot of reflection, I realized I think like a **system builder**:  
- How will this scale?  
- How will teams interact with it?  
- How can it run reliably without constant babysitting?  

That shift led me deeper into **platform engineering**, where I design containerized, cloud-native systems that are scalable, observable, and maintainable. My goal is to bridge the gap between **data engineering** and **infrastructure engineering**, delivering platforms that empower teams to focus on insights, not plumbing.
